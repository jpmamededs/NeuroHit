# NeuroHit
The NeuroHit is a device programmed in an Arduino with C++ designed to auxiliate in the socializing of 1st degree autistic kids at school, using music and cooperation as the main factors to develop better communication between neurotypical and neurodivergent students.

--------------------------------

## üéÆ Developed Gamemodes:

NeuroHit is a very flexible artifact, so it supports tons os gamemodes suitable for various circumstances.

**- Classic Mode**

**- Frenectic Mode**

**- Challenge Mode**

--------------------------------

### ‚ôæÔ∏è Classic Mode:

Each player chooses a color module to play the game. Then, random leds will light up as the song starts playing. The goal is that every user clicks the buttons correspondents to its lighten led under the limit time they remain lit. If one user fails to do that, the game ends. This gamemode is the main mode to be developed in schools to integrate autistic alumns, because the music hits the same brain area as communication and dialogue. Also, as being a co-op game, the kids have to unite themselves to achieve the goal of completing the music, so they have to talk, have fun together and depend on the neurodivergent kid for this.

-----------------------------------

### üî• Frenectic Mode:

It has the same proposal as the *Classic Mode*, but the game gets progressively harder, and there can be up to 8 leds lit at the same time. Also, the time limit to press the buttons gets down to 0.3 seconds.

------------------------------------

### ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Challenge Mode:

Also a 4-player gamemode, but in this, all of the players have to hold their respective modules buttons. When the buttons are held, a roulette-like animation with the leds is lighten up and a single random led is lighten, and then a random challenge is announced by the speaker to the game of the module from the lit led.
